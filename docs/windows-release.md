# ClawScribe Windows Release

This fork is packaged as **ClawScribe** for Windows.

- Tauri product name: `ClawScribe`
- Tauri identifier: `net.rismondo.openclaw.clawscribe`
- Windows publisher/manufacturer: `OpenClaw`
- MSI upgrade code: `8b6aff03-4baa-5d80-9239-e65d85c288d3`
- Bundle targets: `msi`, `nsis`
- Optional OpenClaw endpoint example: `http://openclaw.local:8765/meetings/completed`

Build Windows artifacts on a Windows host with Visual Studio Build Tools,
Windows SDK, Rust, Node.js, pnpm, and LLVM installed. The release script must
be run from `frontend`.

## Release Commit Hygiene

Release commits are metadata-only. They may include the version change,
`CHANGELOG.md` / release-note updates, and updater metadata for the build being
published. Do not include feature code, bug fixes, refactors, dependency churn,
or unrelated docs in a release commit; land those before release prep.

## Prerequisites

Install these on the Windows build host:

- Windows 10/11 or Windows Server with WebView2 Runtime.
- Visual Studio Build Tools 2022 with **Desktop development with C++**.
- Windows 10/11 SDK from Visual Studio Installer.
- Node.js 20 for local parity with the release workflow. GitHub Actions may
  force JavaScript actions to a newer Node runtime as hosted runner policy
  changes.
- pnpm 10.
- Rust stable with the MSVC target:

```powershell
rustup target add x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
```

- LLVM/Clang, with `LIBCLANG_PATH` pointing at the LLVM `bin` directory if
  bindgen cannot find it automatically.
- CMake if any native dependency in the selected feature path requires it.

Stage the Windows `llama-helper` sidecar before running the Tauri bundle:

```powershell
cd <repo-root>
cargo build -p llama-helper --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
Copy-Item .\target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\llama-helper.exe .\frontend\src-tauri\binaries\llama-helper-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe -Force
```

The release script stages the pinned Codex app-server sidecar automatically for
the Advanced Codex provider:

```powershell
cd frontend
.\scripts\stage-codex-runtime.ps1
```

The pinned runtime metadata is in [codex-runtime.md](codex-runtime.md). The
Windows build verifies both the source package SHA256 and runtime executable
SHA256 before bundling.

FFmpeg is downloaded and cached by `frontend/src-tauri/build.rs` during the
Tauri build as `frontend/src-tauri/binaries/ffmpeg-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe`.

Run the validation-only path before a release build:

```powershell
cd frontend
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1 -CheckOnly
```

The release path builds the Tauri desktop app only. It must not require a
standalone Python/FastAPI backend, Docker backend, or manually started
whisper-server.

Build both installer formats:

```powershell
cd frontend
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1
```

If you do not have a Windows build machine, use GitHub Actions instead:

1. Push this branch to GitHub.
2. Open **Actions**.
3. Run **ClawScribe Windows Release** manually.
4. For the normal release artifact, use `feature=windows-gpu`.
5. For a validation-only run, set `check-only=true`; for a publish run, keep
   `check-only=false`.
6. Set `build-ref` to the annotated release tag when publishing, for example
   `v0.5.30`.
7. Leave `publish=false` for a test artifact, or set `publish=true` only when
   the version, release notes, and updater behavior are ready.
8. For non-publish runs, download the `clawscribe-windows-<feature>` artifact
   from the completed run. For publish runs, use the GitHub Release assets.

The workflow builds on the self-hosted Windows ClawScribe runner, stages the
`llama-helper-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` sidecar, stages the pinned Codex
app-server runtime, runs `frontend\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1`, and
uploads or publishes the generated MSI and NSIS installers. Non-publish runs
use 7-day GitHub Actions artifacts. Publish runs upload installer assets,
`latest.json`, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, `BUILD-METADATA.txt`, and
`BUILD-METRICS.json` to the GitHub Release.

The default local release script uses the `windows-gpu` feature set for the
Windows meeting recorder target. `windows-gpu` combines Whisper Vulkan support
with DirectML for ONNX/sherpa paths. Override when needed:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1 -Feature cpu
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1 -Feature directml
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1 -Feature vulkan
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1 -Feature windows-gpu
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1 -Feature cuda
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1 -Feature openblas
```

Artifacts are written under:

```text
frontend\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\*.msi
frontend\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\*.exe
frontend\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\SHA256SUMS.txt
frontend\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\BUILD-METADATA.txt
frontend\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\BUILD-METRICS.json
```

Expected artifact names currently look like:

```text
ClawScribe_0.5.30_x64_en-US.msi
ClawScribe_0.5.30_x64-setup.exe
SHA256SUMS.txt
BUILD-METADATA.txt
BUILD-METRICS.json
```

Published GitHub Releases also include `latest.json` for updater discovery.

`BUILD-METADATA.txt` records the ClawScribe version, build commit,
`upstream_base_version`, Codex runtime version, Codex runtime SHA256, source
package, source URL, and license.

`BUILD-METRICS.json` records release-run diagnostics such as the selected
feature set, sherpa runtime, sherpa staging cache hit/miss, sherpa staging
elapsed seconds, and release build elapsed seconds.

The release script generates `SHA256SUMS.txt` after a successful installer
build. Checksum entries are relative to the bundle root, for example
`msi/ClawScribe_0.5.30_x64_en-US.msi`, so this command verifies cleanly
from `frontend\src-tauri\target\release\bundle`:

```powershell
Get-Content .\SHA256SUMS.txt | ForEach-Object {
    $parts = $_ -split '\s+', 2
    if ((Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 -LiteralPath $parts[1]).Hash.ToLowerInvariant() -ne $parts[0]) {
        throw "Checksum mismatch: $($parts[1])"
    }
}
```

For a local ad-hoc checksum, run:

```powershell
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\*.msi
Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 .\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\*.exe
```

Portable/no-install execution is not the normal release path. For a developer
smoke without installing, run the Tauri dev app:

```powershell
cd frontend
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm tauri dev
```

or run a built app executable directly from the Tauri release output if the
bundle step produced one:

```powershell
.\src-tauri\target\release\ClawScribe.exe
```

Authenticode signing is optional. Set `DIGICERT_KEYPAIR_ALIAS` in the build
environment to enable `frontend/src-tauri/scripts/sign-windows.ps1`; leave it
unset for unsigned local artifacts. Tauri updater signatures are generated only
when `TAURI_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY` is available to the release workflow.

Unsigned artifacts will show an unknown-publisher / SmartScreen warning on
Windows. That is expected for private test builds. Public-friendly installs
require an Authenticode code-signing certificate and a release signing pipeline.

Before handing an installer to a recorder laptop, create or update the
OpenClaw config file from [openclaw-handoff.md](openclaw-handoff.md) and set a
real `MEETILY_OPENCLAW_BEARER_TOKEN` user environment variable on that Windows
machine.

## Smoke Checklist

Use a clean Windows user profile when practical, or uninstall the previous
ClawScribe build first.

1. Install either `frontend\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\*.msi` or
   `frontend\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\*.exe`.
2. Confirm Windows lists the app as `ClawScribe` and publisher/manufacturer as
   `OpenClaw` where the installer surface exposes it.
3. Launch `ClawScribe`, select the local transcription model, and start a short
   recording that captures both microphone and system audio.
4. Stop the recording and confirm a new folder appears under
   `%USERPROFILE%\Music\ClawScribe` with `metadata.json`,
   `transcripts.json`, and audio artifacts.
5. In model settings, select a standalone summary provider first. Recommended
   release smoke path: `Custom OpenAI` with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint,
   model, and API key, or `Built-in AI` if the bundled local summary model is
   already downloaded.
6. Generate a summary for the smoke recording and confirm the meeting detail
   page shows a non-empty summary plus action items.
7. Optional cloud transcription smoke: enable the cloud transcription beta,
   run a short Hosted Whisper retranscription, and confirm real word timestamps
   are present when the provider returns them. Then run a short MAI-Transcribe
   retranscription and confirm rows are saved without word timestamps; if Azure
   collapses the transcript, verify the VAD timing-grid remap creates readable
   rows and the UI does not claim local fallback.
8. Optional cloud fallback smoke: run an oversized Hosted Whisper upload or a
   deliberately invalid cloud credential and confirm ClawScribe notifies the
   user and falls back to local transcription without losing the meeting.
9. Optional OpenClaw provider smoke: configure [openclaw-handoff.md](openclaw-handoff.md),
   set `MEETILY_OPENCLAW_BEARER_TOKEN` as a user environment variable, restart
   `ClawScribe`, select `OpenClaw managed auth`, refresh status, then generate
   a summary and confirm `.openclaw-submitted.json` appears in the recording
   folder.

## Windows-Only Blockers

These items cannot be fully validated from Linux:

- Visual Studio Build Tools and Windows SDK availability.
- `cargo check` and `tauri build` against `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
- Windows `llama-helper-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` sidecar build/staging.
- WiX/MSI and NSIS installer generation, installation, uninstall, and upgrade
  behavior.
- WASAPI microphone/system-audio recording and WebView2 runtime behavior.
- Authenticode signing through DigiCert `smctl`, if signing is enabled.
