# ClawScribe Windows Release

This fork is packaged as **ClawScribe** for Windows.

- Tauri product name: `ClawScribe`
- Tauri identifier: `net.rismondo.openclaw.clawscribe`
- Windows publisher/manufacturer: `OpenClaw`
- MSI upgrade code: `8b6aff03-4baa-5d80-9239-e65d85c288d3`
- Bundle targets: `msi`, `nsis`
- OpenClaw default endpoint: `http://openclaw-host.local:8765/meetings/completed`

Build Windows artifacts on a Windows host with Visual Studio Build Tools,
Windows SDK, Rust, Node.js, pnpm, and LLVM installed. The release script must
be run from `frontend`.

Stage the Windows `llama-helper` sidecar before running the Tauri bundle:

```powershell
cd <repo-root>
cargo build -p llama-helper --release --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
Copy-Item .\target\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\release\llama-helper.exe .\frontend\src-tauri\binaries\llama-helper-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe -Force
```

FFmpeg is downloaded and cached by `frontend/src-tauri/build.rs` during the
Tauri build as `frontend/src-tauri/binaries/ffmpeg-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe`.

Run the validation-only path before a release build:

```powershell
cd frontend
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1 -CheckOnly
```

Build both installer formats:

```powershell
cd frontend
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1
```

The default build uses the `vulkan` feature for the Windows meeting recorder
target. Override when needed:

```powershell
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1 -Feature cpu
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1 -Feature cuda
.\scripts\build-windows-release.ps1 -Feature openblas
```

Artifacts are written under:

```text
frontend\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\*.msi
frontend\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\*.exe
```

Authenticode signing is optional. Set `DIGICERT_KEYPAIR_ALIAS` in the build
environment to enable `frontend/src-tauri/scripts/sign-windows.ps1`; leave it
unset for unsigned local artifacts. Updater artifacts are intentionally disabled
until a ClawScribe release feed and signing key are provisioned.

Before handing an installer to a recorder laptop, create or update the
OpenClaw config file from [openclaw-handoff.md](openclaw-handoff.md) and set a
real `MEETILY_OPENCLAW_BEARER_TOKEN` user environment variable on that Windows
machine.

## Smoke Checklist

Use a clean Windows user profile when practical, or uninstall the previous
ClawScribe build first.

1. Install either `frontend\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\msi\*.msi` or
   `frontend\src-tauri\target\release\bundle\nsis\*.exe`.
2. Confirm Windows lists the app as `ClawScribe` and publisher/manufacturer as
   `OpenClaw` where the installer surface exposes it.
3. Launch `ClawScribe`, select the local transcription model, and start a short
   recording that captures both microphone and system audio.
4. Stop the recording and confirm a new folder appears under
   `%USERPROFILE%\Music\meetily-recordings` with `metadata.json`,
   `transcripts.json`, and audio artifacts.
5. In model settings, select a standalone summary provider first. Recommended
   release smoke path: `Custom OpenAI` with an OpenAI-compatible endpoint,
   model, and API key, or `Built-in AI` if the bundled local summary model is
   already downloaded.
6. Generate a summary for the smoke recording and confirm the meeting detail
   page shows a non-empty summary plus action items.
7. Optional OpenClaw provider smoke: configure [openclaw-handoff.md](openclaw-handoff.md),
   set `MEETILY_OPENCLAW_BEARER_TOKEN` as a user environment variable, restart
   `ClawScribe`, select `OpenClaw managed auth`, refresh status, then generate
   a summary and confirm `.openclaw-submitted.json` appears in the recording
   folder.

## Windows-Only Blockers

These items cannot be fully validated from Linux:

- Visual Studio Build Tools and Windows SDK availability.
- `cargo check` and `tauri build` against `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
- Windows `llama-helper-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.exe` sidecar build/staging.
- WiX/MSI and NSIS installer generation, installation, uninstall, and upgrade
  behavior.
- WASAPI microphone/system-audio recording and WebView2 runtime behavior.
- Authenticode signing through DigiCert `smctl`, if signing is enabled.
