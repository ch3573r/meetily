# OpenAI Auth Modes

> Update: ClawScribe now supports interactive OpenAI/ChatGPT login through
> Codex. See `docs/auth/codex-auth.md`. The OAuth/PKCE notes below still apply
> to direct OpenAI API credentials: ClawScribe must not use private/raw OpenAI
> OAuth endpoints or treat Codex tokens as generic API bearer tokens.

This fork treats OpenAI auth as a production configuration contract for a
distributable desktop app. OpenClaw is an optional integration, not the
foundation for OpenAI auth.

ClawScribe supports direct OpenAI API-key auth, custom OpenAI-compatible
endpoints, and an optional OpenClaw managed endpoint. Public OpenAI OAuth PKCE
metadata is kept as compatibility metadata only; it is not treated as a usable
OpenAI API credential.

## Supported Request Auth

### API Key

Status: supported and request-ready.

The `openai` provider uses the existing `openaiApiKey` value in the local
settings database. Summary generation and model-list calls authenticate OpenAI
API requests with HTTP bearer auth using that API key.

The OpenAI API reference documents bearer credentials for API requests and warns
that API keys are secrets that should not be exposed in client-side code:

- https://developers.openai.com/api/reference/overview#authentication

This desktop app stores the key locally through the existing settings path. The
OpenAI auth status endpoint reports whether the key exists, but never returns it.

Related commands:

- `api_save_model_config`
- `api_get_model_config`
- `api_get_api_key`
- `get_openai_models`
- `api_get_openai_auth_status`
- `api_save_openai_auth_config` with `{ "mode": "api_key" }`

### Standalone OpenAI-Compatible Managed Endpoint

Status: supported through the `custom-openai` provider.

This is the distributable path for an OAuth-backed or operator-managed backend:
the backend owns OAuth/token refresh/secrets, exposes an OpenAI-compatible
`/chat/completions` endpoint, and ClawScribe sends bearer-authenticated requests
to that endpoint. The endpoint can be local, LAN, cloud, or vendor-hosted.

This path does not require OpenClaw.

Configuration shape:

```json
{
  "provider": "custom-openai",
  "customOpenAIEndpoint": "https://model-gateway.example.com/v1",
  "customOpenAIModel": "gpt-5.4",
  "customOpenAIApiKey": "gateway-bearer-token"
}
```

Related commands:

- `api_save_custom_openai_config`
- `api_get_custom_openai_config`
- `api_test_custom_openai_connection`

### Optional OpenClaw Managed Auth

Status: supported and request-ready when an endpoint is configured.

This mode represents an optional production handoff to an OpenClaw endpoint that
owns ChatGPT/Codex-authenticated processing. ClawScribe stores only endpoint
metadata and does not mint, accept, persist, refresh, or expose ChatGPT or Codex
tokens.

In an OpenClaw deployment, this endpoint can be the ingest service's
OpenAI-compatible model bridge:

```text
http://openclaw.local:8765/v1/chat/completions
```

That bridge runs `openclaw infer model run --gateway --model openai/gpt-5.4` on
the trusted OpenClaw host, using the existing OpenClaw/ChatGPT/Codex auth state
there. This is one managed endpoint implementation, not a requirement for the
desktop app.

Configuration shape:

```json
{
  "mode": "openclaw_codex_managed",
  "openclawCodexManaged": {
    "endpoint": "http://openclaw.local:8765/v1/chat/completions",
    "statusEndpoint": "http://openclaw.local:8765/readyz",
    "label": "OpenClaw managed auth bridge"
  }
}
```

Fields:

- `endpoint`: required OpenClaw/local backend endpoint used for managed
  ChatGPT/Codex-authenticated processing.
- `statusEndpoint`: optional endpoint for backend sign-in/readiness checks.
- `label`: optional operator-facing name for the configured backend.

URLs must use `https`, except localhost and `127.0.0.1` endpoints may use
`http` for local desktop backends.

Related command:

- `api_save_openai_auth_config` with `{ "mode": "openclaw_codex_managed" }`

## Public OpenAI OAuth PKCE Metadata

Status: compatibility metadata only, not request-ready by itself.

Public OpenAI OAuth PKCE metadata is intentionally distinct from both standalone
OpenAI API-key auth and managed OpenAI-compatible endpoints. The backend may
still validate legacy PKCE metadata and prepare a short-lived browser
authorization URL for compatibility, but that metadata alone does not
authenticate ClawScribe requests.

Compatibility commands:

- `api_prepare_openai_oauth_pkce_authorization`
- `api_exchange_openai_oauth_pkce_code`

`api_exchange_openai_oauth_pkce_code` returns an error. No OAuth client secret,
access token, refresh token, ChatGPT token, Codex token, or fake token is stored
in source code or settings. For OAuth-backed processing in the distributable app,
use a standalone OpenAI-compatible managed endpoint.

## Disabled Or Not Configured

When no OpenAI auth metadata and no API key are present,
`api_get_openai_auth_status` reports `disabled` with `configured: false`.

## Backend Status Fields

`api_get_openai_auth_status` returns status without returning secrets.

Important fields:

- `mode`: `disabled`, `api_key`, `openclaw_codex_managed`, or `oauth_pkce`.
- `configured`: whether the selected mode has enough local configuration.
- `apiKeyPresent`: whether the OpenAI API key exists.
- `openclawCodexManagedConfigured`: whether managed endpoint metadata exists.
- `openclawCodexEndpointPresent`: whether the managed request endpoint exists.
- `oauthPkceConfigured`: whether legacy public OAuth PKCE metadata exists.
- `oauthBrowserLaunchReady`: whether a legacy authorization URL can be prepared.
- `oauthDeviceFlowConfigured`: whether a legacy device endpoint was configured.
- `canAuthenticateRequests`: true for API-key auth with a stored key, or for
  `openclaw_codex_managed` with an endpoint configured. Custom OpenAI-compatible
  endpoint readiness is reported by the custom provider config/test commands.
- `requestAuthentication`: `bearer_api_key`, `missing_api_key`,
  `openclaw_codex_managed`, `missing_openclaw_codex_endpoint`,
  `unsupported_oauth_pkce`, `disabled`, or `not_configured`.
- `unsupportedReason`: why legacy public OAuth PKCE cannot authenticate
  requests.
- `nextAction`: operator-facing next step.

## Validation Notes

The Rust unit tests cover legacy API-key compatibility, disabled mode, optional
OpenClaw managed endpoint normalization and status capability fields, legacy
public OAuth metadata handling, URL validation, and PKCE S256 authorization
request compatibility.
