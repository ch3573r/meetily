# Changelog

## 0.5.10

- Reworked the custom Windows titlebar into a quiet app-shell drag region:
  branding now lives in the sidebar, while only the native window controls stay
  in the top-right corner.
- Added a Meetings overview page and renamed the old Meeting Notes navigation
  entry to Meetings so saved recordings have a clearer home.
- Rebalanced the collapsed icon rail with primary navigation at the top,
  recording/import actions at the bottom, and a compact status/version footer.
- Polished the Home dashboard, Settings surfaces, Add-ons readiness cards, and
  Meeting details layout for denser desktop use.
- Graduated Import Audio and Retranscribe from beta into the production meeting
  workflow, including cancel/error handling and safer retranscribe warnings.
- Improved recording start feedback so the app acknowledges capture initiation
  immediately while the backend finishes setup.
- Preserved the `latest.json` updater path with runtime version `0.5.10`, so
  installed `0.5.9` clients can discover this update.

## 0.5.0-alpha.2

- Prepared the corrective productization QA/build metadata pass.
- Preserved upstream Meetily Community Edition `0.4.0` attribution.
- Replaced the generated ClawScribe icon set with Alex's supplied app icon.
- Routed summary regeneration through the same user-provided context field as
  first-time summary generation.
- Routed that regeneration context through OpenAI-compatible, OpenClaw, and
  Codex app-server providers, not only the built-in summary path.
- Switched ChatGPT sign-in URL opening away from `cmd /C start`, opened
  device-code verification URLs automatically on Windows, and regenerated icon
  assets with transparent corners.
- Added a Settings → Add-ons tab that exposes Teams detection status, OpenClaw
  handoff, OneNote export, Planner export, and Advanced Codex app-server state.

## 0.5.0-alpha.1

- Productized the fork as ClawScribe.
- Preserved upstream Meetily Community Edition `0.4.0` attribution in About, NOTICE, and UPSTREAM docs.
- Updated package, Tauri, and Cargo product versions to `0.5.0-alpha.1`.
- Updated product-visible UI strings, window metadata, tray tooltip, and notification titles to ClawScribe.
- Documented intentional remaining Meetily references for compatibility and provenance.
